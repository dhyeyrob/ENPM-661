# ENPM661 - Project 1

## Introduction
* This folder consists of python files which are the solution for the 15 puzzle problem, which is the project 1 for the course ENPM661. In this project Brute Force Search(BFS) method is used for developing the search algorithm to solve a 15 puzzle problem.

## Files
* In the folder there are five python files pertaining to the five test cases.

## Following are the five python files
* Test_case_1.py
* Test_case_2.py
* Test_case_3.py
* Test_case_4.py
* Test_case_5.py

## Libraries Required
* Time

## Instructions To Run The Code
* Open the individual python file for each test case.
* Check if required library is installed.
* Run the code
* I have referenced the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 as A, B, C, D, E, F respectively, so please take the reference accordingly. The output will be generated in the console as well as a separate '.txt' text file will be generated for each test case. The output will be initial and solved state along with the path followed by 4x4 matrix starting from the initial node to the solved position.

## Following are the text file names for each test case
* nodePath_Test_case_1.txt
* nodePath_Test_case_2.txt
* nodePath_Test_case_3.txt
* nodePath_Test_case_4.txt
* nodePath_Test_case_5.txt
