# ENPM661 - Project2
## Introduction
* In this project a 300x400 grid is provided where there are five obstacles present. A point robot is given a random start and goal position by the user, and it is required to find its path to the goal location.
* Brute Force Search(BFS) method is used in this project for searching the goal location and the exploration is shown by visualization using half planes method. Moreover, the final optimal path is also represented through visualization.
## Files
* There are three files in the folder. One is the BFS python code, one is the video recording and one is the README file. The files are as follows:
* BFS_point.py
* Video_recording
* README.md
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Open the BFS_point.py file in Pycharm.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* User will be required to enter the x and y co-ordinate of the start as well as the goal location.
* A visualization graph as well as optimal path will be shown if valid start and goal location co-ordinates are provided.
